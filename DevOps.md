DevOps
Part 1 – Setting the Stage (10 min)

    Introduction (5 mins):

        The Vision: Start by stating the goal. "Our objective today is not just to talk about AI, but to design how we can use it to make our work more efficient, creative, and fulfilling. We want to eliminate tedious tasks so we can focus on the complex problems we love to solve."

        The Principle of Co-Design: Emphasize that their input is crucial. "This isn't a top-down decision. We are here to co-design what the future of software engineering looks like at our company, together."

    Warm-Up (5 mins):

        Share one repetitive task/deployment issue and one satisfying reliability win or genuinely engaging task.

Part 2 – Mapping the Present (25 min)

    Activity: Task Brainstorm (15 mins)

        Give everyone sticky notes/shared Miro board etc. Ask them to write down all the tasks they do in a typical week, one task per note. Encourage granularity (e.g., CI/CD maintenance, environment provisioning, alert triage, incident postmortems, infra cost monitoring, config management etc.)

    Activity: Mapping Value vs. Effort (10 mins)

        Draw a 2x2 grid on the whiteboard with "Effort" on one axis and "Value" on the other.

        As a group, place the sticky notes on the grid. This will visually highlight the most frustrating tasks (High-Effort, Low-Value) and the most rewarding ones (High-Effort, High-Value). This sets the stage for identifying where AI can help most.

Part 3 – Human + AI Collaboration (40 min)

    Discussion Point 1: Reclaiming Time (15 mins)

        Key Question: "Looking at our map, which of these tasks do you think we can spend less time on with the help of AI?"

        Prompts: Focus on the High-Effort, Low-Value quadrant. Could AI help with "AI-driven anomaly detection, auto-generated runbooks, predictive scaling, chat-powered incident summarization"?

    Discussion Point 2: Reinvesting Time (15 mins)

        Key Question: "If we freed up 5-10 hours per week, what are some 'high-value activities' you could spend that time on?"

        Prompts: Chaos-engineering drills, architecture hardening, security posture reviews etc.

    Discussion Point 3: Defining the Human Role (10 mins)

        Key Question: "As AI handles more of the code writing, how does our identity as engineers shift?"

        Prompts: Let's define where we must be the "human-in-the-loop". (Examples: Designing resilient patterns, nuanced incident coordination, continuous improvement culture.)

Part 4: Wrap-up and Next Steps (15 mins)

    Synthesize Key Takeaways (10 mins):

        The facilitator summarizes the discussion on the board. "Here are the top 3 tedious tasks we think AI can help with, and here are the top 3 high-value activities we want to do more of."

    Outline What's Next (5 mins):

        "Thank you for this incredible input. The AI Champions team will now research tools that address the specific needs we've identified. We will come back to you in a few weeks with a proposal for a pilot program that we can test together."
